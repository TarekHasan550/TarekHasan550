        <p>I didn’t come from a tech background. I taught myself how to build software not just to code, but to solve problems that matter.
          t long nights breaking things, fixing them, and learning why they work. That’s where I found my edge...  understanding real problems deeply, and building clean solutions that last.
          I don’t chase trends. I build with purpose. That mindet drives every project I take on.
          I’m not just here to build what’s asked. I’m here to understand, improve, and deliver better than expected.
