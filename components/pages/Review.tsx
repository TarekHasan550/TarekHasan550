        <p>
          I don’t just deliver code... I collaborate, ask the right questions, and work with care. Here’s what a few people I’ve worked with had to say, not just about the project, but about the process.

          💬 Demo Testimonials
          “Tarek didn’t just build what I asked for — he improved it. He thought through the details I missed and made sure everything worked smoothly. Working with him felt like having a real technical partner.” — A. Rahman, Small Business Owner

          “He’s the kind of developer who takes ownership. Clear communication, clean results, and no fluff. Every deadline was hit, and every feature had a reason behind it.” — M. Hossain, Project Coordinator
